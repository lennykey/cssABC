What does it do:
Reads the actual view and writes the result to a new tab. The css commands should now be sorted alphabetically in the new tab of sublime. If this is your desired sorting then save it. Only the commands in the tags are sorted but not the tags in the file. 

Install:
Please clone this repository in the Packages folder of sublime.

Fon example in Ubuntu:
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/

git clone https://github.com/lennykey/cssABC.git

Execution of this plugin:
CTRL+SHIFT+A (release this combo) and then press B (release) and then C (mnemonic for cssABC)
